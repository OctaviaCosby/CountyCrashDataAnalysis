# CountyCrashDataAnalysis

The aim of this study is to employ historical car crash data for an in-depth analysis of driver behavior and associated characteristics contributing to the severity of car crashes along the exits of heavily traveled highways, specifically Interstate 95 (I-95) and Interstate 75 (I-75), within Broward County (BC), and Miami-Dade County (MDC) utilizing the information the Florida Department Of transportation (FDOT) has provided. This investigation is significant because it emphasizes the importance of awareness when it comes to activity near exit ramps. 

This investigation can be used to help make our roads safer.

### Questions Needing Answers:
Do the majority of accidents take place in the morning or in later parts of the day?
Which Highway has the Highest Severity Level?
How Much Does Weather Affect the Accident Severity on Each Highway?
How does reckless driving correlate with heightened accident severity?

### Answers:
1 - Better safety measures to be executed such as longer ramps and perhaps slowing down the speed limit near those ramps.
2 -  Some solutions for this would be to add caution signs to exit ramps alerting drivers to poor driving conditions as well as make sure they are well lit.
3 - The biggest things to look at would be off-ramp length, like, is it a sufficient length for drivers to slow their speed from the one they were at before the ramp, as well as the streetâ€™s speed limit.
4 - Given this, more attention to I-75 is recommended. A solution to this could be the implementation of more rest stops and police patrols.
